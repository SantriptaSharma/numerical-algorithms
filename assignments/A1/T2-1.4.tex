With the given formulation, we expect an error to arise by way of catastrophic cancellation near $x = 0$, since there $\cos x$ is close to $1$, and the subtraction of two nearby numbers will lead to a loss in precision. In the worst case, this leads to the denominator being $0$, which makes the whole expression uncomputable. We can substitute $1 - \cos x = \frac{\sin^2 x}{1 + \cos x}$, which avoids this cancellation.\bigskip

Implementing this in code, we see that the first expression cannot be computed for $x = 1e-9$, due to the aforementioned division by $0$. However, the second expression correctly evaluates to $2$ for $1e-9$.
