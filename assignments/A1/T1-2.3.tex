Solving the system after changing $201$ to $200$, we see that two of the three solutions become imaginary ($0.9949 \pm 0.10037i$), which means there is no coherent distance metric between $1$ and them, so $1$ is not "even close" to them, by vacuity.\bigskip

The third solution is real, but is $100.0102$, which is also not really close to $1$. Then, a slight change in the input (coefficients) lead to a major change in the output (solution), so this problem is ill-conditioned.
